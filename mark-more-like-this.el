;; 'mark-more-like-this marks the ARG next matches (previous if negative)
;;
;; 'mark-next-like-this marks the next occurance.
;;     - with a negative ARG, removes the last occurance.
;;     - with a zero ARG, skips the last occurance and marks the next.
;;
;; 'mark-previous-like-this works like -next- but in the other direction.
;;
;; This extension is dependent on the mark-multiple library.
